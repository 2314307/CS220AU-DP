## Self-assessment
Using the marking rubric, I've assessed my own progress: <!-- move the symbols in the table below -->

I enjoyed writing this blog because I could write what I wanted to know more about this topic and I could know now. I would say it is a good structure for this essay. If I put it directly on GitHub, it would be difficult to read and correct, so I first wrote it in Word and then copied it to GitHub. However, I should have started earlier because this one is more than just an essay we need to put this to GitHub. Once I learned how to bold, incorporate images, include references, etc., I could proceed easily.

## Peer-assessment
Another student in my group provided feedback on my work as follows: <!-- move the symbols in the table below -->

Structure is well explained
The way you given the references are also well organized. In the digital identites paragraph where you are explaining about it in that line you have given extra spacing on the first sentence. The work was reasonable and well written, but the descripted the structure needed to be improved to address the specific of the data. You must ensure you fully understood about the information which you are providing and address it carefully.However, The example which you have given and the way you have presented in knowledge and the concept is markable. Your digital portfolio could benefit from a more detailed exploration of how AI intersects with psychedelic music. Consider providing specific examples or projects where AI has been applied to generate or enhance psychedelic music. Discuss the algorithms, techniques, or tools used, emphasizing the technical aspects alongside the creative outcomes. Additionally, highlight any insights gained from this fusion, such as the exploration of new sonic landscapes or the potential for AI to contribute to evolving music genres. This will give your audience a deeper understanding of your expertise and the innovative connections you're making between technology and art.
