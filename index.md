### Definitions and Classifications
The best way to progress is to first understand what DIs and ERs are, so let's define them and classify their types. One method that can help us understand DIs is the Visitors and Residents Map, developed by White and Le Cornu. It is based on people's motivation to engage with the Web and has two modes: visitor and resident modes, and is further refined by whether we engage in an activity in a personal or an institutional (professional) manner. In a nutshell, in visitor mode activities **we don't leave a social trace behind** (e.g., searching/reading information on the Web, watching videos, shopping, paying our bills). (Remember that search engines could store your search history and website cookies can crawl data from you even in your visiting modes!) In resident mode activities we are present with other people and **leave a social trace behind**. A footprint of our activities stays online after we leave the internet (e.g., by creating content or commenting on other people's content on online platforms [websites, social media]). As these activities are public, they can be linked to our identities, and therefore we should exercise caution while using the Web in this mode. (We should be careful when we use our visitor modes as well, of course!) An example of personal engagement is using social media or emails to communicate with friends and family about personal matters. An example of professional activities is disseminating or discussing ideas as a worker or a student in higher education (HE) online (or print).
